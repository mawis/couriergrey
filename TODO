What is left to do
==================

- Detect mail that has been received with authentication
  (AUTH in the first Received header from the right IP
  address.)
- Whitelisting by destination (i.e. disable greylisting for
  some destination addresses)
- Configuration file for locations and greylisting time
- Think about reducing the blocksize of the database
- Autowhitelisting for senders that have received mails
